          I am a student of the edX full-stack coding bootcamp.  Web development has been an interest of mine my whole life, and I&apos;m excited to have been able to complete this bootcamp to get such a thorough introduction to so many technologies, and the ability to build applications with these technologies.  I am currently seeking full time employment to use my new skills and to continue to grow my skills.
